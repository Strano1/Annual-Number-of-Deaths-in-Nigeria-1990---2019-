# Annual-Number-of-Deaths-in-Nigeria-1990---2019-
I made use of SQL Server to study datasets containing worldwide statistics of deaths, 33 causes of these deaths and the years of these deaths. The aim of this project is to analyze the figures specifically from the country, Nigeria, and as such, it seeks to provide information on the number of deaths in Nigeria, within the time frame of 1990 - 2019, and the causes of these deaths. Other insights got include: year with the most deaths,year with least deaths, average number of deaths, top causes of the most deaths.  I included notes to show what detail each line of code aims to find out.
